# Titanic Survival Prediction with Generative AI ðŸš¢ðŸ¤–

#### Overview
I used **Generative AI** to create new features for the Titanic dataset and tested how they improved survival prediction accuracy.  
Accuracy went from **81.6% â†’ 83.2%** after adding AI-generated features.

#### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset from Kaggle.

#### Features Created
- **FamilySize** â€“ total number of family members aboard
- **IsAlone** â€“ whether passenger traveled alone
- **Title** â€“ honorific from name (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
- **AgeGroup** â€“ passengerâ€™s age category
- **FarePerPerson** â€“ fare divided by family size

#### Model Comparison
| Model                | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Without AI Features  | 81.6%    |
| With AI Features     | 83.2%    |
